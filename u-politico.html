                    <p class="text-center">After long periods of successive dominance by Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.), Ukraine finally achieved full independence in the 20th century. Ukraine had experienced a brief period of independence in 1918â€“20, but parts of western Ukraine were ruled by Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia in the period between the two World Wars, and Ukraine subsequently joined the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (December 1, 1991). With the Soviet Union ' s collapse in December 1991, Ukraine attained total autonomy. The nation officially changed its name to Ukraine, and it contributed to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a grouping of nations that were once Soviet Union republics</p>

                      <p class="text-center">The Congress ' field operations have so far benefited over 220 mayors, 300 local council members, and 350 young local leaders from all regions of Ukraine. Additionally, partnerships with national associations of municipal and regional authorities have been strengthened to support the transition and build on the successes of the previous years.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">Voting rights are available to citizens who are at least 18 years old. The Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU), a division of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was the only recognized political party in Ukraine up until 1990. Significant laws that were approved by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet came from or were authorized by the CPU. New political parties were given official recognition in October 1990 after the Ukrainian constitution was changed. A diverse range of parties then developed. However, many parties have lacked solid organizational foundations and unifying platforms, and as a result, individual parties have a tendency to create parliamentary blocs.</p>
