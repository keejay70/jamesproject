                    <p class="text-center">Being a country with an open economy, actively trading with foreign countries and producing products whose prices are formed on world markets, Kazakhstan largely depends on the situation in the international economic arena. That is why in the Forecast of socio-economic development of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020-2024, approved by the Government, an important role is given to the analysis of relevant risks.</p>

                    <h2>ECONOMIC OVERVIEW</h2>
                    <p>Kazakhstan's economic growth is largely based on gas and oil revenues (around 35% of GDP and 75% of exports). In 2019, Kazakh GDP grew by 4.5%, as domestic demand, business spending and construction boom supported economic activity. In 2020, Kazakhstan's economy experienced a setback due to the COVID-19 outbreak, reporting a negative growth balance of 2.6%, but came back in 2021 with a rate of + 3.3%. According to the latest IMF forecast, growth is expected to increase in 2022 and 2023, at 3.9% and 5.8% of GDP respectively.</p>

                    <p class="text-right">Kazakhstan benefits from multiple natural resources. Major deposits of oil, natural gas, coal, iron ore, manganese, chromium ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, lead, zinc, bauxite or uranium. The country also has a large agricultural area (ranked 6th world), composed of arable land and pastures. Agriculture suffered from a strong decline in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, but has recovered in the last 20 years. The sector accounts for 5.4% of GDP and employs 15% of the working population. Agriculture in the country is extensive, but ageing infrastructure limits its development. More than half of the products are vegetable crops (cereals, including wheat, oilseeds, cucurbits). Kazakhstan is one of the world's leading wheat producers. Livestock and dairy industries account for a significant share of the agricultural sector. Kazakhstan is almost self-sufficient in agri-food.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">The Kazakh industry has been grown in the last few years, now accounting for 33.1% of GDP and employing 21% of the working population. Metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, hydrocarbon production, textiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and fertilizers are the main industrial products.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The tertiary sector is the main sector in Kazakhstan and growing steadily. It accounts for 56.1% of GDP and employs 64% of the working population. The financial sector, transport and technology are the main services produced in the country. The tourism sector, although not yet very developed, was experiencing strong growth. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic halted this development. Moreover, the pandemic has hit severely retail, hospitality, wholesale, and transport sectors, which account for around 30% of employment, and are mostly concentrated in cities.</p>

                    <h2>FOREIGN TRADE</h2>
                    <p>Kazakhstan is open to international trade. According to the World Bank, the share of international trade in 2020 amounted to 56.2% of GDP. Kazakhstan has an export-oriented economy that is highly dependent on shipments of oil and related products (73 percent of total exports). In addition to oil, its main export commodities include natural gas, ferrous metals, copper, aluminum, zinc and uranium. Kazakhstan's main export products are raw materials, notably oil, petroleum products, coal, iron ore, machinery. Cereals, wool and meat are other major exports. The country imports mainly machinery, nuclear reactors, boilers, Electrical, electronic equipment, and radiotelephone transmitting devices.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Kazakhstan's main international customers are China (19% of all exports), Italy and Russia, while the main suppliers are Russia (35%), China, South Korea and Germany. Russia and Kazakhstan have undertaken joint projects in many areas, including energy. The government aims to improve the country's integration abroad to increase investment in the country. The country has been a WTO member since 2015 and has trade agreements with many countries in its region. It is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), and the Common Economic Zone (Belarus and Russia). The Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) was signed in 2015 between the country and the European Union, and a revised version entered into force in March 2020.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">As oil and gas are among Kazakhstan's main exports, the country's trade balance depends is affected by global commodity prices. Kazakhstan’s total foreign trade turnover amounted to 91.3 billion USD over the period from January through November 2021, an increase of 15.4% compared to 79.1 billion USD during the same period last year. This means that the EU accounts for 31% of all Kazakh foreign trade. The increase is trade has largely been due to the increased amount of freight moving across Eurasia from China to Europe, with the trans-Kazakh route one of the heaviest used. Kazakh imports from China usually arrive by the same rail route and reached about US$8 billion in value in 2021. With these containers being offloaded at Kazakhstan, space is then available for Kazakh goods to continue west to Europe.Kazakhstan’s Statistics Committee has stated that Kazakhstan’s trade with the countries of the European Union reached 28.4 billion USD during the period January – November 2021, which is a 25.6% increase over the 22.6 billion USD achieved during the same period in 2020 (Silk road briefing, 2022).  In 2020, total U.S.–Kazakhstan goods trade was 2.3 billion USD, with the United States holding a negative trade balance of 461 million USD.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">The article provides an analysis of the financial stability of Kazakhstan’s economy. It was revealed that in our country, the presence of rich common resources and stable economic policy led to the formation of a favourable investment structure in the country and, as a result, to the rapid development of the national economy and the industrial sector. The article also considers the key risks and forecasts of the social and economic development of Kazakhstan for the coming years and their scenario forecasts for the further development of the republic. The goals of sustainable development are given separately in the article both in Kazakhstan and in the world according to online resources, in particular newspapers, and to the sources of the UN Development Program in the field of sustainable development. In general, the types of industry in Kazakhstan are also reflected: ferrous metallurgy (12.5%), non-ferrous metallurgy (12%), gas industry, chemical industry, textile industry (0,2%), engineering (8%), production of building materials, oil and oil refining industry, light industry (4%), food industry, fuel and energy complex. Kazakhstan is also a world leader in uranium production.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">According to the July IMF forecast, amid worsening sentiment in the financial markets and growing uncertainty regarding countries' policies in world trade, and also taking into account low inflation with increasing risk of disinflationary expectations, the global economic growth in 2019 will slow to 3.2%, with a subsequent increase to 3.5 % in 2020.</p>

                    <p class="text-right">The slowdown in the global economy is associated with a decrease in growth dynamics in developed countries due to weakening investment inflows and increased productivity, reduced demand for consumer durables and limited long-term costs that affect the dynamics of industrial production</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Growth in emerging and developing economies is expected at 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively. In developed economies, growth is projected in 2019 at 1.9%, followed by a slowdown to 1.7% in 2020</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">In general, as noted above, in the medium term, the growth of the world economy will be favorable and will be ensured largely due to developing countries amid moderate growth in developed countries. At the same time, risks that can cause negative trends remain. The first risk is trade wars and inconsistent business processes. Strengthening protectionism, tightening business restrictions, trade wars (USA - China), as well as inconsistency of trade and economic regimes of Great Britain and the European Union can lead to a slowdown in world trade, putting pressure on the decline in economic activity.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The second risk is US sanctions against Russia and Iran. The US sanctions policy, which has turned into a global factor, not only affects the current state of the global economy and its long-term changes, but also creates potential risks for the partner countries of Russia and Iran. The United States sends a direct signal to third-country businesses that cooperation with the Russian and Iranian sub-sanctions businesses is undesirable and could entail “secondary restrictions” on the American side. The third risk is the deterioration of the geopolitical situation in the world. The unfavorable geopolitical situation in Ukraine, Syria, and the Middle East as a whole causes additional risk regarding secondary channels of foreign trade and foreign direct investment. This trend leads to an increase in unemployment and a decrease in demand for low-paid labor, thereby increasing the risks of an influx of migrants and an outflow of skilled personnel into developed markets.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Latest research and publications analysis. A number of local authors such as Azhar Z. Nurmagambetova (2018) and others have devoted their works to express analysis and financial risks of companies in economic situations [3]. There are many articles considering the analysis of problems and assessment of the sustainable development of the state system [13, 14]. For example, foreign authors of the work of N.S. Lukashevich, E.A. Konnikov [15] devised and tested a methodology for approach to assessment of financial stability of industrial enterprises as a basis of sustainable development. In many scientific articles, research authors based on all the studied and collected financial reports for the entire economic structure (for individual industries, including industry) test traditional bankruptcy diagnostic models, finding a strong variation of bankruptcy probability estimates.</p>
