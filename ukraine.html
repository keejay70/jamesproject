                    <p class="text-center">Eastern Europe includes the nation of Ukraine. After Russia, which it shares borders with to the east and northeast, it is the second-largest nation in Europe. The area of Ukraine is roughly 600,000 square kilometers.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Ukraine has 43,139,581 inhabitants. The official language is the East Slavic Language.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">According to projections, Ukraine's GDP will decrease by around 35% in 2022 as a result of reduced labor supply, damage to arable land, and the destruction of production capacity. The predicted cost of recovery and reconstruction in the social, economic, and infrastructure sectors is $349 billion, or more than 1.5 times the size of Ukraine's pre-war economy in 2021. Also brought on by the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the current global crisis of mass people migration.</p>

Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic halted this development. Moreover, the pandemic has hit severely retail, hospitality, wholesale, and transport sectors, which account for around 30% of employment, and are mostly concentrated in cities.</p>

                    <p>Eastern Europe's Ukraine is a nation that borders both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovakia are neighbors. The Carpathian Mountains in the west, the Crimean Peninsula in the extreme south, and rich lowlands and plateaus make up the majority of Ukraine. The president serves as the head of state, and the prime minister is in charge of the government. The political system is a republic. Ukraine has a mixed economic system that combines centralized economic planning, limited individual freedom, and government regulation.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">Depending on the U.S. company's business model and connection with its Ukrainian trading partner, different payment methods and terms apply. Until both sides establish a record of payment, it may be wise for newly established businesses to ask Ukrainian customers for an advance payment for goods and services. While all modes of payment recognized globally (such as checks, bills of exchange, letters of credit, and collection agreements) are accepted in Ukraine, it is advised to use an irrevocable letter of credit to get payment for American exports.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and commercial banks of various types and forms of ownership make up the two tiers of the Ukrainian banking sector. The NBU is in charge of setting monetary policy, approving commercial banks, and monitoring their operations. Savings, investment, mortgage, and settlement (clearing) banks are included in the category of "specialized" commercial banks under the current Ukrainian law, which distinguishes them from "universal" (generic) commercial banks. A commercial bank operates under the authority of a banking license granted by the NBU.</p>

                      <h4 class="text-center">CAN I USE USD IN UKRAINE?</h4>
                      <p class="text-center">To make sure that everything is hassle free, convert your USD to Hryvnia since USD and EUROS are the easiest currency to exchange in Ukraine.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">The most recent Financial Stability Report emphasizes efforts to maintain financial sector stability as well as risks and hazards posed by Russian military actions. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine has set off a serious crisis with far-reaching repercussions for the financial industry. The war will cause the GDP to decrease by more than one-third while also driving inflation well above its desired level.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">The currency rate has been temporarily fixed, preventing unchecked depreciation. The FX market is still under pressure at the same time. To reduce exchange rate swings, the NBU has been interfering in the market by selling sizable sums of foreign currency. In order to make hryvnia deposits more appealing and to lessen pressure on the FX market, among other things, the NBU dramatically increased its key policy rate in June. This choice encourages banks to increase deposit interest rates. It should also yield more on domestic government debt securities.</p>
