                        <h2>Kazakhstan Culture</h2>
                        <p>Kazakhstan culture reflects the history of the nomadic tribes which roamed the Kazakh steppe forming their unique worldview, creating eclectic customs and traditions, and mixing with neighboring cultures. Many Kazakhs adopted a more sedentary lifestyle in the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to the development of new cultural characteristics for Kazakhs, such as huge, glittering, modern cities. Today, Kazakhstan culture represents the peoples of large swaths of Central Asia, capturing this nomadic spirit in various types of arts and traditions.</p>

                        <p class="text-right">Kazakh yurt is a portable dwelling, which nomads can quickly and easily assemble then disassemble to load onto horses or camels as they seek new pastures. For Kazakhs, the yurt is truly a home–a symbol of comfort, connection with the earth and the universe, and reminder of the nomadic past. It consists of three connected elements: kerege (latticework) form the walls of the yurt, yuk (domes of poles) the roof of the yurt, with shanyrak (peaks) serving as a skylight. Yurts are so revered that shanyrak are depicted on the National Emblem of Kazakhstan.</p>

                        <p>The ability to stay in the saddle is an integral part of nomadic life. Riders can showcase their skills in the various kazakh horse games that have become traditional on the Kazakh steppe. Kokpar, with its Central Asian counterparts Kok-Bar (Kyrgyzstan), Kupkari (Uzbekistan), and Buzkashi (Tajikistan), is the most popular horse game in Kazakhstan. The team version of Kokpar, called Ulak, is the struggle for the carcass of a ram, which must be scooped up at a gallop and dragged to a certain place without giving it away to rivals. Alaman Baiga, a long-distance racing game in which only local breeds of horses are allowed, can cover distances of 10, 20, 50 or even 100 kilometers. "Kyz Kuu" is another Kazakh favorite–in this game, a man must to catch up with and kiss a girl.</p>

                    <h2>Kazakh Music</h2>
                    <p>Kazakhstan’s musical heritage is based on folklore and historically had no musical notation–the heavily improvised music was passed from teacher to student, generation to generation. Kui, a uniquely Kazakh genre in which a musician performs on the dombra (a plucked Kazakh instrument) and sings stories from epics, legends, and fairy tales, became popular in the 15th-17th centuries. The most famous performer of kui was the 19th century musician Dauletgerei. At the beginning of the 20th century, a classical music academy was founded to draw upon Russian and European styles while weaving in traditionally Kazakh motifs.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">Kazakhs are big fans of storytelling and poetry. A passion for poetry has been a part of Kazakh culture for millennia–legends have been told and retold. The most famous epics are the classic “Korkyt-ata” and “Oguznam”. Kazakh poets in the Middle Ages usually told their works accompanied by dombra or kobyz (plucked musical instruments), and arranged reading competitions called "aytyz", which resemble modern rap-battles. The written literary tradition of Kazakhstan only goes back to the 19th century. Abai Kunanbayev, whose name adorns settlements, streets, theaters, schools and universities in Kazakhstan today, stands out among the writers of that time.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Crafts of Kazakhstan</h2>
                    <p class="text-center">The nomadic way of life, which became the basis of Kazakhstan culture, left its mark on folk crafts. Traveling from place to place, people created everything they needed for a long stay on the road. Underlining the transient nature of the people, Kazakh crafts are highlighted by essentials for survival and creating coziness on the road: woodworking, felt for upholstering yurts, and the creation of horse riding equipment. In the harsh climate of the steppe, where the summer is very hot and the winter winds are unbearably cold, the Kazakhs developed handicrafts for making warm fur coats and hats made of leather and animal fur. Blacksmithing and jewelry making were also widespread.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Kazakhstan has successfully integrated into the world community during the 21st century but has also worked tirelessly to carefully preserve folk traditions and customs. The knowledge and ways of life of the ancient ancestors who conquered and roamed the Kazakh steppe are still passed down from generation to generation. Travelers can learn more about Kazakh culture in the country’s numerous museums or during festivals and holidays.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Kazakhstan is unique in that its people, the Kazakhs, did not form the majority of the population upon independence in 1991. Currently the northern part of the country is populated mostly with Ukrainian and Russian majorities while Kazakhs are more prevalent in the south. Other prevalent nationalities include Germans, Uzbeks, and Tatars, and over one hundred different nationalities reside in the country.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">It is the goal of the government for the Kazakhs to become the majority of the population throughout the country. This can be seen in many overt and covert actions and policies. Many street names have reverted to their historical names. Kazakh has been declared the national language of the country (even though many native Kazakhs cannot speak their own language). Expatriated Kazakhs have been invited to return home and settle. Couples are encouraged to have large families. It is important to note that the people of Kazakhstan, inclusive of all ethnic groups living in the country, are called Kazakhstani. Only people of the Kazahk ethnic group are called Kazahks. If you are not sure of someone’s ethnic background, it is safest to refer to them as Kazakhstanis.</p>

                        <p class="text-right">The word "Kazakh" means "a free and independent nomad" in ancient Turkish. Kazakhs have travelled along the steppes of Kazakhstan from western China to the southern border of Russia for centuries. For centuries Kazakhstan was a country of nomads and herders. Tribes were the basis of society; the tribe was constituted of family members and the family elders. Inter-tribal marriages were important in establishing security and peace. To this day, Kazakhs say, "the matchmaking lasts a thousand years, while the son-in-law lasts only a hundred." Arranged marriages are still the norm in many parts of the country.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">The Kazakhs developed a patriarchal view of the world. They banded together in extended family groups to battle the hardships of the environment and to protect their cattle and their families. This was officially called "ata-balasy", which means the joining of a grandfather’s sons into one tribe of extended family. The husband plays the primary role in family life and is ultimately responsible for the family’s survival.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                      <p>Kazakhstan is also an extremely hierarchical society. Everyone has a distinct place in the hierarchy based upon family relationships. People are respected because of their age and position. Older people are viewed as wise and therefore they are granted respect. The "ways of the elders" is a popular expression that is used to explain why things are done in prescribed ways. Kazakhs expect either the eldest or the person with the highest position to make decisions that are in the best interest of the group.</p>

                        <li>Once you have developed a personal relationship, close friends of the same sex may prefer to hug rather than shake hands.</li>
                        <li>Most Kazakhs have a first and patronymic name (the father’s name followed by a suffix -ich or –ovich for son of or daughter of, respectively).</li>
                        <li>Wait until invited before using someone’s first name, although the invitation generally comes early in the relationship.</li>

                        <li>Kazakhs are very hospitable people and enjoy hosting dinners at their homes.</li>
                        <li>You will be served tea and bread, even if you are not invited to a meal. Since Kazakhs consider bread to be sacred, serving bread is a sign of respect.</li>
                        <li>When served tea, your cup will often only be filled halfway. To fill the cup would mean that your host wanted you to leave.</li>
                        <li>It is not imperative that you arrive on time, although you should not arrive more than 30 minutes late without telephoning first.</li>
                        <li>Dress conservatively in clothing you might wear to the office. Kazakhs value dressing well over comfort. To dress too informally might insult your hosts.</li>
                        <li>Table manners are not terribly formal in Kazakhstan.</li>
                        <li>Table manners are Continental -- the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.</li>

                        <li>Meals are social events. As such, they may take a great deal of time.</li>
                        <li>Leave something on your plate when you have finished eating. This demonstrates that you have had enough, whereas if you finish everything it means you are still hungry and you will be served more food.</li>
                        <li>Expect to be served second helpings.</li>

They tend to speak in a roundabout fashion rather than a linear fashion. They respond more favourably to gentle probing rather than direct questioning.</li>
                        <li>At the same time, many Kazakhs have a somewhat volatile demeanour and can raise their voice to get their point across. They are known for their fierce arguments. You may wish to retaliate in kind, but do so cautiously as there is a fine line between standing up for yourself and appearing overly aggressive.</li>
                        <li>Hierarchy is respected in Kazakhstan. Someone more senior is never ever contradicted or criticised, especially in public. You will be expected to treat senior Kazakhs in the same manner.</li>

                      <h4>Business Meetings</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Meeting styles vary by the type of business entity. Private industry is often more focused and westernized; things are a little bit more fluid. Public entities, on the other hand, follow lots of protocol and red-tape (leftovers from the Communist era). The latter may involve many more meetings and patience.</li>
                        <li>The hierarchical nature of the culture means that Kazakhs will want to meet people of similar rank. Therefore, it is important to forward the bios of all team members well in advance of any meeting.</li>
                        <li>T-shaped tables are often used for meetings so that both sides can be seated opposite each other. The top Kazakh at the meeting will sit at the head and his staff will be seated in decreasing order of rank. Your team should attempt to seat themselves in the same manner. In some companies, there is an emerging trend to seat peers next to each other to facilitate conversation.</li>
                        <li>There is generally a fair amount of small talk before business is discussed. This may take place over tea and sweets. Wait for the other party to bring the conversation to business</li>
                        <li>Spend time in relationship building; as a family orientated people they want to be sure you are trustworthy, affable and reliable.</li>
                        <li>The most senior Kazakh at the meeting opens the discussion and introduces his team in rank order. Although meetings have a start time, they seldom have an ending time. They are masters at delivering roundabout speeches. Therefore, it would be impractical to predetermine when a meeting will finish.</li>
