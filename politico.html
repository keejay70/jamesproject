                        The OECD Review of Regulatory Policy in Kazakhstan uses as framework of assessment the 2012 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Regulatory Policy and Governance.

                      <p class="text-center">The Kazakh Government has put in place many elements of regulatory policy, including setting formal requirements on procedures for making regulations, establishing advisory councils to conduct public consultation, developing an online database of legislation, introducing a requirement to conduct a “scientific expertise” of draft regulations, conducting reviews of existing legislation.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">Significant administrative simplification measures have also been undertaken in recent years. However, more is needed to ensure the effective implementation of these elements for regulatory management. Progress can be achieved by developing practical tools and training in support of the work of officials.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">Training and capacity building also need to be strengthened in a number of key regulatory management areas. Many regulatory tools need to be refined and further developed. Existing requirements could be improved by adapting existing rules and setting more detailed practical procedures.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">This report provides a set of recommendations and policy option recommendations for developing regulatory management policy and improving regulations in Kazakhstan including the adoption of a comprehensive, whole-of-government policy on regulatory quality, establishing a government body responsible for promoting regulatory quality, improving the consultation process and establishing a fully-fledged regulatory impact procedure when preparing new regulations.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">The politics of Kazakhstan takes place in the framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President of Kazakhstan is head of state and nominates the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">None of the elections held in Kazakhstan have been considered free or fair by Western standards with issues noted including ballot tampering, multiple voting, harassment of opposition candidates and press censorship.</p>

                        <h2>Executive branch</h2>
                        <p>The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The prime minister and first deputy prime minister are appointed by the president. Council of Ministers is also appointed by the president. President Nazarbayev expanded his presidential powers by decree: only he can initiate constitutional amendments, appoint and dismiss the government, dissolve Parliament, call referendums at his discretion, and appoint administrative heads of regions and cities.</p>
                        <p>The president is the head of state. He also is the commander in chief of the armed forces and may veto legislation that has been passed by the Parliament. President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was in office since Kazakhstan became independent, won a new 7-year term in the 1999 election that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said fell short of international standards. A major political opponent, former prime minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, was prohibited from running against the president because he had attended an unauthorized meeting of "the movement for free elections".</p>

                        <p class="text-center">The legislature, known as the Parliament (Parliament), has two chambers. The Lower House Assembly (Mazhilis) has 107 seats, elected for a four-year term, 98 seats are from party lists, 9 - from Assembly of People. All MPs are elected for 5 years.[3] The Upper House Senate has 47 members, 40 of whom are elected for six-year terms in double-seat constituencies by the local assemblies, half renewed every two years, and 7 presidential appointees. In addition, ex-presidents are ex officio senators for life. Majilis deputies and the government both have the right of legislative initiative, though most legislation considered by the Parliament is proposed by the government. Several deputies are elected from the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan.</p>

                        <p class="text-center">There are 65 judges on the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan. There are seven members of the Constitutional Council. Out of the 7 members, 3 are appointed by the president.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">There are local and oblast (regional) level courts, and a national-level Supreme Court. Local level courts serve as courts of first instance for less serious crimes such as theft and vandalism. Oblast level courts hear more serious criminal cases and also hear cases in rural areas where no local courts have been established.[4] A judgment by a local court may be appealed to the oblast level. The Supreme Court is a cassation court that hears appeals from the oblast courts.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">The constitution establishes a seven-member Constitutional Council to determine the constitutionality of laws adopted by the legislature. It also rules on challenges to elections and referendums and interprets the constitution. The president appoints three of its members, including the chair.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">Under constitutional amendments of 1998, the president appoints a chairperson of a Higher Judicial Council, which nominates judges for the Supreme Court. The Council consists of the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, the chairperson of the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General, the Minister of Justice, senators, judges, and other persons appointed by the president. The president recommends and the Senate (upper legislative chamber) approves these nominees for the Supreme Court. Oblast judges (nominated by the Higher Judicial Council) are appointed by the president. Lower level judges are appointed by the president from a list presented by the Higher Judicial Council. Under legislation approved in 2000, judges serve for life.</p>
