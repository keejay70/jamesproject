                    <p class="text-center">The Constitution of the Republic of Belarus of 1994, as amended and supplemented by the national referendums of 24 November 1996, 17 October 2004 and 27 February 2022, provides for the fundamental structure of the Belarusian state. The Republic of Belarus is a unitary democratic welfare and rule-of-law state.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The Republic of Belarus exercises supreme control and absolute authority over its territory and implements its domestic and foreign policies in an independent manner.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">The state authority in the Republic of Belarus is exercised on the basis of separation of powers into legislative, executive and judicial branches. Essentially, this principle prevents concentration of all power in the hands of one particular government body, it is instead divided between three branches of government. These branches are independent within their powers: they interact with each other on the basis of mutual checks and balances.</p>

                  <p class="text-center">Winds of change have begun to blow in Belarus, the former Soviet republic known as ‘Europe’s last dictatorship’. Over the past five months, the country has been rocked by unprecedented nationwide protests over rigged presidential election results and police brutality against protesters, with national and international observers sounding alarms about violence and ill-treatment of citizens at the hands of police.</p>
                  <p class="text-center">While Belarus scored 47 on the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index, an improvement of two points since last year, its score does not reflect the countless problems that the country has been facing under Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. The CPI measures countries based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be by experts and businesses. The CPI does not capture electoral fraud, infringements on freedom of speech and right to assembly, nor the rampant human rights abuses that the people of Belarus are fighting against.</p>

                        <p class="text-center">Intentional homicides are estimates of unlawful homicides purposely inflicted as a result of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups. Intentional homicide does not include all intentional killing; the difference is usually in the organization of the killing. Individuals or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded.</p>
