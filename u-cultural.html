                      <p class="text-center">Ukrainians can trace their nation's origins to the 9th century, when Kyivan Rus' was established with Kyiv as its capital. It was a sizable medieval state that connected numerous Slavic tribes and stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. Grand Prince Volodymyr the Great and his son, Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, oversaw Kyivan Rus' , which was ruled by the Rurikid dynasty, and they brought about the country's greatest prosperity.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">The commercial network of Kyivan Rus' was highly developed, and it was a component of the crucial trade route "from the Varangians to the Greeks" that linked Scandinavia and Byzantium during the Middle Ages. Volodymyr the Great produced his own coinage, like many other kings of that era. 400 or more of them may exist.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">In February 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled that language legislation passed in 2012 that allowed languages spoken by at least 10% of an oblast's population to be given the status of "regional language" and allowed their use in courts, schools, and other government institutions was unconstitutional. The languages in question were Ukrainian (official), which made up 67.5% of the population, Russian (regional language), which made up 29.6%, and other, which included small Crimean Tatar-, Moldovan/Romani</p>

                      <p class="text-center">In the Ukraine, direct communication is encouraged, but there is also a focus on conveying information delicately. The degree of a relationship will frequently dictate how straightforward a person is. Obviously, people will be more cautious in fresher relationships. Once a connection has been made, people will feel more at ease communicating openly.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">All kids between the ages of 7 and 15 must attend nine years of compulsory education. Upper secondary school or a career path are options after a comprehensive school. Upper secondary school: a three-year general education program that culminates in the matriculation examination, which grants successful students admission to universities and other higher learning institutions. The current vocational education system offers both general secondary and vocational programs, with distinct pathways for those who have graduated from high school and those who have not. It is being reformatted.</p>

                      <p class="text-center">With the use of online distant learning tools and television broadcasts of video classes, Ukraine additionally put in place mechanisms to facilitate remote teaching and learning. During the COVID-19 issue, organizations like EdCamp Ukraine created peer-to-peer learning and online professional development opportunities for teachers to connect virtually and share experiences with online learning. In order to inform teachers, administrators, students, and parents about the standards for safe and sustained learning under COVID-19 in the 2020–21 school year, Ukraine also organized communication programs, such as "Schools, We Are Ready, " in partnership with UNICEF.</p>
                      <h2 class="text-center">IMPACT OF WAR</h2>
                      <p class="text-center">Displacement of educators and students. More than 6 million Ukrainians have fled to nearby nations as a result of the war in their country. This includes more than 25,000 teachers (6% of all teachers in the nation) and close to 665,000 students (16% of all students enrolled). Another 8 million Ukrainians are internally displaced.1 The majority of refugees and IDPs are children, women, and older people. More than 74% of IDPs live in households with kids.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">Displacement has had a significant impact on education service delivery, along with damage and destruction of educational facilities. As of May 6, 2022, according to the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (MoES), 1,635 schools and universities (5% of total) have been damaged from the war and 126 have been destroyed.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">Impact on Learning Opportunities and Learning Results. War or pandemic-related school closures can have long-lasting negative effects on learning because they affect all aspects of a student's learning opportunity: I less time spent learning, (ii) poorer quality instruction delivered remotely or online, and (iii) less content covered during instruction.</p>
