                    <p class="text-center">Being a country with an open economy, actively trading with foreign countries and producing products whose prices are formed on world markets, Kazakhstan largely depends on the situation in the international economic arena. That is why in the Forecast of socio-economic development of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020-2024, approved by the Government, an important role is given to the analysis of relevant risks.</p>

                    <h2>ECONOMIC OVERVIEW</h2>
                    <p>Kazakhstan's economic growth is largely based on gas and oil revenues (around 35% of GDP and 75% of exports). In 2019, Kazakh GDP grew by 4.5%, as domestic demand, business spending and construction boom supported economic activity. In 2020, Kazakhstan's economy experienced a setback due to the COVID-19 outbreak, reporting a negative growth balance of 2.6%, but came back in 2021 with a rate of + 3.3%. According to the latest IMF forecast, growth is expected to increase in 2022 and 2023, at 3.9% and 5.8% of GDP respectively.</p>

                    <p class="text-right">Kazakhstan benefits from multiple natural resources. Major deposits of oil, natural gas, coal, iron ore, manganese, chromium ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, lead, zinc, bauxite or uranium. The country also has a large agricultural area (ranked 6th world), composed of arable land and pastures. Agriculture suffered from a strong decline in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, but has recovered in the last 20 years. The sector accounts for 5.4% of GDP and employs 15% of the working population. Agriculture in the country is extensive, but ageing infrastructure limits its development. More than half of the products are vegetable crops (cereals, including wheat, oilseeds, cucurbits). Kazakhstan is one of the world's leading wheat producers. Livestock and dairy industries account for a significant share of the agricultural sector. Kazakhstan is almost self-sufficient in agri-food.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">The Kazakh industry has been grown in the last few years, now accounting for 33.1% of GDP and employing 21% of the working population. Metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, hydrocarbon production, textiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and fertilizers are the main industrial products.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The tertiary sector is the main sector in Kazakhstan and growing steadily. It accounts for 56.1% of GDP and employs 64% of the working population. The financial sector, transport and technology are the main services produced in the country. The tourism sector, although not yet very developed, was experiencing strong growth. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic halted this development. Moreover, the pandemic has hit severely retail, hospitality, wholesale, and transport sectors, which account for around 30% of employment, and are mostly concentrated in cities.</p>

                    <h2>FOREIGN TRADE</h2>

Kazakhstan has an export-oriented economy that is highly dependent on shipments of oil and related products (73 percent of total exports). In addition to oil, its main export commodities include natural gas, ferrous metals, copper, aluminum, zinc and uranium. Kazakhstan's main export products are raw materials, notably oil, petroleum products, coal, iron ore, machinery. Cereals, wool and meat are other major exports.

                    <p class="text-center">Kazakhstan's main international customers are China (19% of all exports), Italy and Russia, while the main suppliers are Russia (35%), China, South Korea and Germany. Russia and Kazakhstan have undertaken joint projects in many areas, including energy. The government aims to improve the country's integration abroad to increase investment in the country. The country has been a WTO member since 2015 and has trade agreements with many countries in its region. It is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), and the Common Economic Zone (Belarus and Russia). The Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) was signed in 2015 between the country and the European Union, and a revised version entered into force in March 2020.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">As oil and gas are among Kazakhstan's main exports, the country's trade balance depends is affected by global commodity prices. Kazakhstan’s total foreign trade turnover amounted to 91.3 billion USD over the period from January through November 2021, an increase of 15.4% compared to 79.1 billion USD during the same period last year. This means that the EU accounts for 31% of all Kazakh foreign trade. The increase is trade has largely been due to the increased amount of freight moving across Eurasia from China to Europe, with the trans-Kazakh route one of the heaviest used. Kazakh imports from China usually arrive by the same rail route and reached about US$8 billion in value in 2021. With these containers being offloaded at Kazakhstan, space is then available for Kazakh goods to continue west to Europe.Kazakhstan’s Statistics Committee has stated that Kazakhstan’s trade with the countries of the European Union reached 28.4 billion USD during the period January – November 2021, which is a 25.6% increase over the 22.6 billion USD achieved during the same period in 2020 (Silk road briefing, 2022).  In 2020, total U.S.–Kazakhstan goods trade was 2.3 billion USD, with the United States holding a negative trade balance of 461 million USD.</p>
