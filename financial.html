                    <p class="text-center">The article provides an analysis of the financial stability of Kazakhstan’s economy. It was revealed that in our country, the presence of rich common resources and stable economic policy led to the formation of a favourable investment structure in the country and, as a result, to the rapid development of the national economy and the industrial sector. The article also considers the key risks and forecasts of the social and economic development of Kazakhstan for the coming years and their scenario forecasts for the further development of the republic. The goals of sustainable development are given separately in the article both in Kazakhstan and in the world according to online resources, in particular newspapers, and to the sources of the UN Development Program in the field of sustainable development. In general, the types of industry in Kazakhstan are also reflected: ferrous metallurgy (12.5%), non-ferrous metallurgy (12%), gas industry, chemical industry, textile industry (0,2%), engineering (8%), production of building materials, oil and oil refining industry, light industry (4%), food industry, fuel and energy complex. Kazakhstan is also a world leader in uranium production.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">According to the July IMF forecast, amid worsening sentiment in the financial markets and growing uncertainty regarding countries' policies in world trade, and also taking into account low inflation with increasing risk of disinflationary expectations, the global economic growth in 2019 will slow to 3.2%, with a subsequent increase to 3.5 % in 2020.</p>

                    <p class="text-right">The slowdown in the global economy is associated with a decrease in growth dynamics in developed countries due to weakening investment inflows and increased productivity, reduced demand for consumer durables and limited long-term costs that affect the dynamics of industrial production</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Growth in emerging and developing economies is expected at 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively. In developed economies, growth is projected in 2019 at 1.9%, followed by a slowdown to 1.7% in 2020</h3>
                    <p class="text-center">In general, as noted above, in the medium term, the growth of the world economy will be favorable and will be ensured largely due to developing countries amid moderate growth in developed countries. At the same time, risks that can cause negative trends remain. The first risk is trade wars and inconsistent business processes. Strengthening protectionism, tightening business restrictions, trade wars (USA - China), as well as inconsistency of trade and economic regimes of Great Britain and the European Union can lead to a slowdown in world trade, putting pressure on the decline in economic activity.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The second risk is US sanctions against Russia and Iran. The US sanctions policy, which has turned into a global factor, not only affects the current state of the global economy and its long-term changes, but also creates potential risks for the partner countries of Russia and Iran. The United States sends a direct signal to third-country businesses that cooperation with the Russian and Iranian sub-sanctions businesses is undesirable and could entail “secondary restrictions” on the American side. The third risk is the deterioration of the geopolitical situation in the world. The unfavorable geopolitical situation in Ukraine, Syria, and the Middle East as a whole causes additional risk regarding secondary channels of foreign trade and foreign direct investment. This trend leads to an increase in unemployment and a decrease in demand for low-paid labor, thereby increasing the risks of an influx of migrants and an outflow of skilled personnel into developed markets.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Latest research and publications analysis. A number of local authors such as Azhar Z. Nurmagambetova (2018) and others have devoted their works to express analysis and financial risks of companies in economic situations [3]. There are many articles considering the analysis of problems and assessment of the sustainable development of the state system [13, 14]. For example, foreign authors of the work of N.S. Lukashevich, E.A. Konnikov [15] devised and tested a methodology for approach to assessment of financial stability of industrial enterprises as a basis of sustainable development. In many scientific articles, research authors based on all the studied and collected financial reports for the entire economic structure (for individual industries, including industry) test traditional bankruptcy diagnostic models, finding a strong variation of bankruptcy probability estimates.</p>

                      <p class="text-right">The models of bankruptcy probability estimates based on the established and traditional analysis of all indicators (ratios), can help diagnose the financial condition, however, with some significant reservations: 1) not only the formally obtained indicator, but also many component factors (both quantitative and qualitative), which may affect the financial condition should be considered; 2) the choice of a specific financial model should take into account the main industry and industry specifics of production enterprises; 3) the valuation methodology should first of all apply such key needles (indicators) as the gearing ratio (debt to equity ratio), current (current) assets and current liabilities</p>
